{1.1}{Locate a discussion of Russel's paradox, and understand it.}{

Recall that, in naive set theory, any collection of objects that satisfy some
property can be called a set. Russel's paradox can be illustrated as follows.
Let $R$ be the set of all sets that do not contain themselves. Then, if $R\notin
R$, then by definition it must be the case that $R\in R$; similarly, if $R\in R$
then it must be the case that $R\notin R$.

{1.2}{$\rhd$ Prove that if $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on a set $S$, then
the corresponding family $\mathscr{P}_{\sim}$ defined in \S1.5 is indeed a
partition of $S$; that is, its elements are nonempty, disjoint, and their union
is $S$.  [\S1.5]}{

Let $S$ be a set with an equivalence relation $\sim$. Consider the family of
equivalence classes w.r.t. $\sim$ over $S$:


\[ \mathscr{P}_{\sim} = \set{[a]_{\sim} \mid a\in S} \]

Let $[a]_{\sim}\in\mathscr{P}_{\sim}$. Since $\sim$ is an equivalence relation,
by reflexivity we have $a\sim a$, so $[a]_{\sim}$ is nonempty. Now, suppose
$a$ and $b$ are arbitrary elements in $S$ such that $a\not\sim b$. For
contradiction, suppose that there is an $x\in [a]_{\sim}\cap[b]_{\sim}$. This
means that $x\sim a$ and $x\sim b$. By transitivity, we get that $a\sim b$; this
is a contradiction. Hence the $[a]_{\sim}$ are disjoint. Finally, let $x\in S$.
Then $x\in[x]_{\sim}\in \mathscr{P}_{\sim}$. This means that

\[ \bigcup_{[a]_{\sim} \in \mathscr{P}_{\sim}} [a]_{\sim} = S, \]

that is, the union of the elements of $\mathscr{P}_{\sim}$ is $S$. \QEDA

{1.3}{$\rhd$ Given a partition $\mathscr{P}$ on a set $S$, show how to define a

Define, for $a,b\in S$, $a\sim b$ if and only if there exists an
$X\in\mathscr{P}$ such that $a\in X$ and $b\in X$. We will show that
$\mathscr{P} = \mathscr{P}_{\sim}$. 

\tpar
1. ($\mathscr{P}\subseteq\mathscr{P}_{\sim}$). Let $X\in \mathscr{P}$; we want to
show that $X\in\mathscr{P}_{\sim}$. We know that $X$ is
nonempty, so choose $a\in X$ and consider $[a]_{\sim}\in\mathscr{P}_{\sim}$. We
need to show that $X=[a]_{\sim}$. Suppose $a'\in X$ (it may be that $a'=a$.)
Since $a,a'\in X$, $a\sim a'$, so $a'\in[a]_{\sim}$. Now, suppose $a'\in
[a]_{\sim}$. We have $a'\sim a$, so $a'\in X$. Hence $X=[a]_{\sim}\in
\mathscr{P}_{\sim}$, so $\mathscr{P}\subseteq\mathscr{P}_{\sim}$.

2. ($\mathscr{P}_{\sim}\subseteq\mathscr{P}$). Let $[a]_{\sim}\in\mathscr{P}_{\sim}$.
From exercise I.1.1 we know that $[a]_{\sim}$ is non-empty. Suppose
$a'\in[a]_{\sim}$. By definition, since $a'\sim a$, there exists a set $X$ such
that $a,a'\in X$. Hence $[a]_{\sim}\subseteq X$. Also, if $a,a'\in X$ (not
necessarily distinct) then $a\sim a'$. Therefore,
$\mathscr{P}_{\sim}\subseteq\mathscr{P}$, and with 1. we get that the sets
$\mathscr{P}$ and $\mathscr{P}_{\sim}$ are equal.

{1.4}{How many different equivalence relations can be defined on the set
$\{1,2,3\}?$}{

From the definition of an equivalence relation and the solution to problem
\textbf{I.1.3}, we can see that an equivalence relation on $S$ is equivalent to
a partition of $S$. Thus the number of equivalence relations on $S$ is equal to
the number of partitions of $S$. Since $\{1,2,3\}$ is small we can determine
this by hand:

\tpar
\[ \mathscr{P}_0 = \set{\{1,2,3\}} \]
\[ \mathscr{P}_1 = \set{\{1\},\{2\},\{3\}\}} \]
\[ \mathscr{P}_2 = \set{\{1,2\},\{3\}} \]
\[ \mathscr{P}_3 = \set{\{1\},\{2,3\}} \]
\[ \mathscr{P}_4 = \set{\{1,3\},\{2\}} \]

Thus there can be only $5$ equivalence relations defined on $\{1,2,3\}$.

{1.5}{Give an example of a relation that is reflexive and symmetric but not
transitive. What happens if you attempt to use this relation to define a
partition on the set? (Hint: Thinking about the second question will help you
answer the first one.)}{

For $a,b\in \mathbf{Z}$, define $a\diamond b$ to be true if and only if
$\abs{a-b}
\leq 1$. It is reflexive, since $a\diamond a = \abs{a-a} = 0 \leq 1$ for any $a\in
\mathbf{Z}$, and it is symmetric since $a\diamond b = \abs{a-b} = \abs{b-a} = b\diamond
a$ for any $a,b\in \mathbf{Z}$. However, it is not transitive. Take for example
$a=0, b=1, c=2$.  Then we have $\abs{a-b} = 1\leq 1$, and $\abs{b-c} = 1\leq 1$, but
$\abs{a-c} = 2 > 1$; so $a\diamond b$ and $b\diamond c$, but not $a\diamond c$.

\tpar
When we try to build a partition of $\mathbf{Z}$ using $\diamond$, we get
"equivalence classes" that are not disjoint. For example, $[2]_{\diamond} =
\{1,2,3\}$, but $[3]_{\diamond} = \{2,3,4\}$. Hence $\mathscr{P}_{\diamond}$ is
not a partition of $\mathbf{Z}$.

{1.6}{Define a relation $\sim$ on the set $\mathbf{R}$ of real numbers by
setting $a\sim b\iff b-a\in\mathbf{Z}$. Prove that this is an equivalence
relation, and find a `compelling' description for $\mathbf{R}\,/\!\sim$. Do the
same for the relation $\approx$ on the plane $\mathbf{R}\times\mathbf{R}$ by
declaring $(a_1,b_1)\approx(a_2,b_2)\iff b_1-a_1\in\mathbf{Z}$ and
$b_2-a_2\in\mathbf{Z}$. [\S II.8.1, II.8.10]}{

Suppose $a,b,c\in\mathbf{R}$. We have that $a-a=0\in\mathbf{Z}$, so $\sim$ is
reflexive. If $a\sim b$, then $b-a=k$ for some $k\in\mathbf{Z}$, so
$a-b=-k\in\mathbf{Z}$, hence $b\sim a$. So $\sim$ is symmetric. Now, suppose that
$a\sim b$ and $b\sim c$, in particular that $b-a=k\in\mathbf{Z}$ and
$c-b=l\in\mathbf{Z}$. Then $c-a=(c-b) + (b-a) = l+k\in\mathbf{Z}$, so $a\sim c$.
So $\sim$ is transitive.

\tpar
An equivalence class $[a]_{\sim}\in\mathbf{R}\,/\!\sim$ is the set of integers
$\mathbf{Z}$ transposed by some real number $\epsilon\in[0,1)$. That is, for
every set $X\in\mathbf{R}\,/\!\sim$, there is a real number $\epsilon\in[0,1)$
such that every $x\in X$ is of the form $k+\epsilon$ for some integer $k$.

\tpar
Now we will show that $\approx$ is an equivalence relation over
$\mathbf{R}\times\mathbf{R}$. Supposing $a_1,a_2\in\mathbf{R}\times\mathbf{R}$,
we have $a_1-a_1=a_2-a_2=0\in\mathbf{Z}$, so $(a_1,a_2)\approx(a_1,a_2)$. If we
also suppose that $b_1,b_2,c_1,c_2\in\mathbf{R}\times\mathbf{R}$, then symmetry
and transitivity can be shown as well: $(a_1,a_2)\approx(b_1,b_2)\implies
b_1-a_1=k$ for some integer $k$ and $b_2-a_2=l$ for some integer $l$, hence
$a_1-b_1=-k\in\mathbf{Z}$ and $a_2-b_2=-l\in\mathbf{Z}$, so
$(b_1,b_2)\approx(a_1,a_2)$; also if $(a_1,a_2)\approx(b_1,b_2)$ and
$(b_1,b_2)\approx(c_1,c_2)$, then
$(b_1,b_2)-(a_1,a_2)=(k_1,k_2)\in\mathbf{Z}\times\mathbf{Z}$ as well as
$(c_1,c_2)-(b_1,b_2)=(l_1,l_2)\in\mathbf{Z}\times\mathbf{Z}$, so $(c_1,c_2) -
(a_1,a_2) = (c_1,c_2) - (b_1,b_2) + (b_1,b_2) - (a_1,a_2) = (k_1+l_1,
k_2+l_2\in\mathbf{Z}\times\mathbf{Z}$. Thus $\approx$ is an equivalence
relation.

\tpar
The interpretation of $\approx$ is similar to $\sim$. An equivalence class
$X\in\mathbf{R}\times\mathbf{R}\,/\approx$ is just the 2-dimensional integer
lattice $\mathbf{Z}\times\mathbf{Z}$ transposed by some pair of values
$(\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2)\in[0,1)\times[0,1)$.

{2.1}{How many different bijections are there between a set with $n$ elements
and itself?}{

A function $f:S\to S$ is a graph $\Gamma_f\subseteq S\times S$. Since $f$ is
bijective, then for all $y\in S$ there exists a unique $x\in S$ such that
$(x,y)\in\Gamma_f$. We can see that $\abs{\Gamma_f} = n$. Since each $x$ must be
unique, all the elements $x\in S$ must be present in the first component of
exactly one pair in $\Gamma_f$. Furthermore, if we order the elements $(x,y)$ in
$\Gamma_f$ by the first component, we can see that $\Gamma_f$ is just a
permutation on the $n$ elements in $S$. For example, for $S=\{1,2,3\}$ one such
$\Gamma_f$ is:

\[ \set{ (1,3), (2,2), (3,1) } \]

Since $\abs{S} = n$, the number of permutations of $S$ is $n!$. Hence there can be
$n!$ different bijections between $S$ and itself.

construct a set $\Lambda_b$ of such pairs:

\[ g(b) = a, \text{ where $a$ is in some $(a,b)\in\Lambda_b$} \]

Now, $g$ is a right-inverse of $f$. To show this, let $b\in B$. Since $f$ in
surjective, $g$ has been defined such that when $a=g(b)$, $f(a)=b$, so we get
that $f(g(b)) = (f\circ g)(b) = b$, thus $g$ is a right-inverse of $f$.

\exercise{2.8}{Describe as explicitly as you can all terms in the canonical
decomposition (cf. \S2.8) of the function $\mathbf{R}\to\mathbf{C}$ defined by
$r\mapsto e^{2\pi ir}$. (This exercise matches one previously. Which one?)}{

Let $f:\mathbf{R}\to\mathbf{C}$ be as above. The first piece in the canonical
decomposition is the equivalence relation $\sim$ defined as $x \sim x' \iff f(x) =
f(x')$, i.e. $[x]_{\sim}$ is the set of all elements in $\mathbf{R}$ that get
mapped to the same element in $\mathbf{C}$ by $f$ as $x$.

\tpar
The second piece is the set $\mathscr{P}_{\sim}$. This set is the set of all
equivalence classes of $\mathbf{R}$ over equality up to $f$. Note that, since
$f(x) = e^{2\pi i x} = \cos(2\pi x) + i\sin(2\pi x)$, $f$ is periodic with
period $1$. That is, $f(x) = e^{2\pi i x} = e^{2\pi i x + 2\pi} = e^{2\pi i (x +
1)} = f(x+1)$. In other words, we can write $\mathscr{P}_{\sim}$ as,

\[ \mathscr{P}_{\sim} = \set{\set{r + k\mid k\in\mathbf{Z}}\mid
r\in[0,1)\subseteq\mathbf{R}}, \]

and it is here when we notice uncanny similarities to exercise \textbf{1.6}
where $x\sim y$, for $x,y\in\mathbf{R}$, if and only if $x-y\in\mathbf{Z}$, in
which we could have written $\mathscr{P}_{\sim}$ in the same way. 

\tpar
Now we will explain the mysterious $\tilde{f}:\mathscr{P}_{\sim}\to\im f$. This
function is taking each \textit{equivalence class} $[x]_{\sim}$ over the reals
w.r.t. $\sim$ and mapping it to the element in $\mathbf{C}$ that $f$ maps each
element $x'\in[x]_{\sim}$ to; indeed, since $x\sim x'$ is true for
$x,x'\in\mathbf{R}$ if and only if $f(x)=f(x')$, we can see that for any
$x\in\mathbf{R}$, for all $x'\in[x]_{\sim}$, there exists a $c\in\mathbf{C}$
such that $f(x') = c$. To illustrate with the equivalence class over
$\mathbf{R}$ w.r.t. $\sim$ corresponding to the element $0\in\mathbf{R}$, we
have $[0]_{\sim} = \set{\dots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \dots}$.  We can see that
$e^{-4\pi i} = e^{-2\pi i} = e^{0\pi i} = 1 = e^{2\pi i} = e^{4\pi i}$, etc; so
the function would map $[0]_{\sim}\mapsto1\in\mathbf{C}$, and so on.
Furthermore, we can see that $\tilde{f}$ is surjective, since for $y$ to be in
$\im f$ is to say that there is an $x\in\mathbf{R}$ such that $f(x) = y$; so
there must be an equivalence class $[x]_{\sim}$ which is mapped to $y$ by
$\tilde{f}$.

\tpar
Finally, the simple map from $\im f\to\mathbf{C}$ that simply takes $c\mapsto
c$. This can be thought of as a potential ``expansion'' of the domain of
$\tilde{f}$. It is obviously injective, since (trivially) $c\neq c'\implies
c\neq c'$. However, it may not be surjective: for example, $2\in\mathbf{C}$ is
not in $\im f$ as it is defined above.

that $h(x) = f(x) = y$. So $h$ is surjective. Now, suppose that $x\neq x'$, for
$x,x'\in A'\cup B'$. If $x,x'\in A'$, then since $f$ is injective and $h(x) =
f(x)$ for all $x\in A'$, then $h(x)\neq h(x')$. Similarly for if $x,x'\in B'$.
Now, without loss of generality if $x\in A'$ and $x'\in B'$, then $h(x) = f(x)

$A'\cup B'\cong A''\cup B''$.

\abs{B}^{\abs{A}}$ for all sets $A$ such that $\abs{A}=k-1$. Suppose that
$\abs{A}=k$. Let $a\in A$. (We can do this since $\abs{A}=k\geq 2$.) Then, by
the inductive hypothesis, since $\abs{A\backslash\{a\}}=k-1$,
$\abs{B^{(A\backslash\{a\})}} = \abs{B}^{\abs{A}-1}$. Let $F$ be the set of
functions from $A\backslash\{a\}$ to $B$.  Then, for each of those functions
$f\in F$, there is $\abs{B}$ ``choices'' of where to assign $a$: one choice for
each element in $B$. Hence, $\abs{B^A} = \abs{B}\abs{B}^{\abs{A}-1} =
\abs{B}^{\abs{A}}$ as required.

{2.11}{$\rhd$ In view of Exercise 2.10, it is not unreasonable to use $2^A$ to denote
the set of functions from an arbitrary set $A$ to a set with $2$ elements (say
$\{0,1\}$). Prove that there is a bijection between $2^A$ and the \textit{power
set} of $A$ (cf. \S1.2). [\S1.2, III.2.3]}{

Let $S = \{0,1\}$, and consider $f:\mathcal{P}(A)\to 2^A$, defined as

\[ f(X) = \set{(a,1) \text{ if $a\in X$, and }(a,0) \text{ otherwise}} \]

We will show that $f$ is bijective. Let $g\in 2^A$. Then $f$ is a
function from $A$ to $S$. Let $A_1 = \set{a\in A\mid g(a) = 1}$. Then $A_1$ is a
set such that $A_1\in\mathcal{P}(A)$, and $f(A_1)=g$. Hence $f$ is surjective.

Now, suppose that $X,Y\subseteq A$ and $f(X) = f(Y)$. Then, for all $a\in A$,
$a\in X \iff f(X)(a) = 1 \iff f(Y)(a) = 1 \iff a\in Y$. Hence $f$ is injective,
so $2^A\cong\mathcal{P}(A)$.

\subsection{Category theory}

\exercise
{3.1}{$\rhd$ Let $\mathsf{C}$ be a category. Consider a structure
$\mathsf{C}^{op}$ with
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\Obj(\mathsf{C}^{op}) = \Obj(\mathsf{C})$
\item For $A, B$ objects of $\mathsf{C}^{op}$ (hence objects of $\mathsf{C}$),
$\Hom_{\mathsf{C}^{op}}(A, B) := \Hom_{\mathsf{C}}(B, A)$.
\end{enumerate}
Show how to make this into a category (that is, define composition of morphisms
in $\mathsf{C}^{op}$ and verify the properties listed in \S3.1).

Intuitively, the `opposite' category $\mathsf{C}^{op}$ is simply obtained by
`reversing all the arrows' in $\mathsf{C}$. [5.1, \S III.1.1, \S IX.1.2,
IX.1.10]}{

For objects $A,B,C\in\Obj(\mathsf{C}^{op})$, the set of morphisms between $A$
and $B$ in $\mathsf{C}^{op}$, $\Hom_{\mathsf{C}^{op}}(A,B)$, is defined as
$\Hom_{\mathsf{C}}(B, A)$. Similarly for the morphisms between $B$ and $C$. So
for morphisms $f\in\Hom_{\mathsf{C}^{op}}(A,B)$ and
$g\in\Hom_{\mathsf{C}^{op}}(B,C)$, to define composition we recall the
set-function $\circ_{\mathsf{C}} : \Hom_{\mathsf{C}}(C,B) \times
\Hom_{\mathsf{C}}(B,A) \to\Hom_{\mathsf{C}}(C,A)$ that is defined for the
objects $A,B,C\in\Obj(\mathsf{C})=\Obj(\mathsf{C}^{op})$; we shall define the
composition of morphisms $f:A\to B$ and $g:B\to C$ in $\mathsf{C}^{op}$ with
this function. Precisely, we define

\[ \circ_{\mathsf{C}^{op}}: \Hom_{\mathsf{C}^{op}}(A,B) \times
\Hom_{\mathsf{C}^{op}}(B,C) \to \Hom_{\mathsf{C}^{op}}(A,C) \]

to be

\[ \circ_{\mathsf{C}^{op}}(f,g) = \circ_{\mathsf{C}}(g,f) \]

for all $f\in\Hom_{\mathsf{C}^{op}}(A,B)$ and $g\in\Hom_{\mathsf{C}^{op}}(B,C)$.
The domain and codomain of $\circ_{\mathsf{C}}$ and $\circ_{\mathsf{C}^{op}}$
match (up to transposing the coordinates in the domain) due to the equality of
$\Hom_{\mathsf{C}}(A,B)$ with $\Hom_{\mathsf{C}^{op}}(B,A)$.

\tpar
To show that this composition makes $\mathsf{C}^{op}$ a category, first we note
that the fact that $\mathsf{C}$ is a category implies the existence of a
morphism $1_{A}$ taking $A$ to itself where $A\in\Obj(\mathsf{C})$; this
morphism is thus also present in $\Hom_{\mathsf{C}^{op}}(A,A) =
\Hom_{\mathsf{C}}(A,A)$. Secondly, for objects $A,B,C,D\in\Obj(\mathsf{C})$, any
morphisms $f\in\Hom_{\mathsf{C}^{op}}(A,B)$, $g\in\Hom_{\mathsf{C}^{op}}(B,C)$,
and $h\in\Hom_{\mathsf{C}^{op}}(C,D)$ are associative, since

\[ (h \circ_{\mathsf{C}^{op}} g) \circ_{\mathsf{C}^{op}} f = f
\circ_{\mathsf{C}} (g \circ_{\mathsf{C}} h) = (f \circ_{\mathsf{C}} g)
\circ_{\mathsf{C}} h = h \circ_{\mathsf{C}^{op}} (g \circ_{\mathsf{C}^{op}} f).
\]

Finally, for any morphism $f\in\Hom_{\mathsf{C}^{op}}(A,B)$ we have,

\[ f \circ_{\mathsf{C}^{op}} 1_A = 1_A \circ_{\mathsf{C}} f = f \text{ and }
1_B \circ_{\mathsf{C}^{op}} f = f \circ_{\mathsf{C}} 1_B = f; \]

hence the identities are ``identities with respect to composition''. Last, for
objects $A,B,C,D\in\Obj(\mathsf{C})$ where $A\neq C$ and $B\neq D$,
clearly $\Hom_{\mathsf{C}}(B,A)\cap\Hom_{\mathsf{C}}(D,C)=\emptyset$ is true iff 
$\Hom_{\mathsf{C^{op}}}(A,B)\cap\Hom_{\mathsf{C^{op}}}(C,D)=\emptyset$. Hence
$\mathsf{C}^{op}$ is a category.

\exercise
{3.2}{If $A$ is a finite set, how large is $\mathrm{End}_{\mathsf{Set}}(A)$?}{

The set $\mathrm{End}_{\mathsf{Set}}(A)$ is the set of functions $f:A\to A$.
Since $A$ is finite, write $\abs{A} = n$ for some $n\in\mathbf{Z}$. By exercise
2.10, we know that $\abs{A^A} = \abs{A}^{\abs{A}} = n^n$. So the the set
$\mathrm{End}_{\mathsf{Set}}(A)$ has size $n^n$.
