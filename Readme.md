Solutions to Paolo Aluffi's *Algebra: Chapter 0*.

PDF can be find inside the 'release' branch.

*Algebra: Chapter 0* is a highly regarded introduction to abstract algebra and category theory. The writing is fantastic and the exercises are very fun; it's like CS 135 assignments in that they're not too difficult (compare: advanced math courses), but very insightful and rigorous (compare: CS 251).

I am doing this for two reasons:
1. If you want to start working through the text as well you can! It's a very good text that assumes no prior experience except for some mathematical maturity, i.e. you should be able to write mathematical proofs.
2. So that you can spot errors, should you find yourself reading the solutions. I'm not doing the exercises as part of a course so I don't really get graded.
